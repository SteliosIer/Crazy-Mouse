# Crazy-Mouse
Project for the C++ Course at Athens University of Economics and Business during winter of 2023/24.  

Create a simple one player game with mouse character, using the sgg library. You have to eat cheese to collect points (1 point per piece) and avoid traps and cats. When you eat 3 pieces of cheese you turn into a monster and you can eat cats (2 points per cat). When you eat 2 cats monster becomes a normal mouse again. Game ends when you collect 10 points.
